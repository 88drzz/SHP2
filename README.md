# SHP2
Title: "E76K mutation promotes SHP2 activation by rewiring allosteric networks that drives conformational transitions"
The code placed here consists of scripts for constructing a Markov State Model (MARKOV.ipynb) and a Neural Relational Inference Model (NRI.ipynb), along with the parameter files (in a zip format) used in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.
Due to the large file sizes, the relevant PDB structure files, GRO files, and other files pertaining to the molecular dynamics simulations, as well as the input and output data associated with the Neural Relational Inference (NRI) model, have been made publicly available on the Zenodo platform. The input data used for the Markov model, which consists of MD trajectories, has not been uploaded due to its large file size.Access the link https://zenodo.org/records/15581363.
The data uploaded to the Zenodo platform includes: (1) initial PDB structure files, GRO files, TPR files, TOP files, RMSD, and RMSF for 10 MD simulations, contained within the MD_WT and MD_E76K files; (2) initial PDB structure files used in the Markov State Model; and (3) initial PDB structure files and some output matrix files used in the Neural Relational Inference (NRI) Model.
